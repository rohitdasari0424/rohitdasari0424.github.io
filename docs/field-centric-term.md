<b>Field-centric movement</b> is a key component to this path following algorithm. Field-centric is very different compared to the
conventional Robot-centric movement for one key reason. To understand the core difference, let's take a robot facing south as an example.
In a Robot-centric movement algorithm, telling the robot to move forward would cause the robot to move further south. In a Field-centric movement
algorithm , however, telling the robot to move forward would cause it to strafe towards the north. In other words, <b>Field-centric movement</b>
occurs in relation to the field while Robot-centric occurs in relation to the robot heading.
