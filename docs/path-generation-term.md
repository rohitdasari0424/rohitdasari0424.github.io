# Path Generation

---

<b>Path Generation</b> will be used to do two things:
- Inject the path with more points
- Smooth the path

---
## Injecting the path

Injecting the path is an important part of getting a smooth path. The injecting algorithm calculates how many evenly spaced points would fit in each line segment of the path and then injects them. The end result would be a new path with the exact same shape , but more points along its individual line segments

## Smoothing the path

Smoothing the path takes a
2D array of XY coordinates and returns a smoother version of the coordinates. It works best when the inputted path consists of many points.

The main goal of the path generation is to make the path more smooth which in turn will make the robot movement smoother and accurate.
